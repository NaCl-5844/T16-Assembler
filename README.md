# T16-Assembler
Assembles T16 assembly into machine code

## Ecosystem

[Assembler:](https://github.com/NaCl-5844/t16-assembler)
- Takes assembly file and outputs binary* to a file
  - *WIP: Currently waiting for T16 to have opcode values
- The code can easily conform to other instruction sets if they follow the formatting used in the supporting files. I may experiment with this in the future and try make the modification process streamlined.

[Emulator:](https://github.com/NaCl-5844/t16-emulator)
- WIP: Will make the repo public once I have hit version 1.0.0 (usable)
